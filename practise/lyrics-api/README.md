# two api projects
### main2.py uses genius api which doesn't provide lyrics unfortunatuly and a second api which I deleted because it was unfortunately depricated
### main.py uses spotify scrapper api to provide info about song by using http://localhost:8000/lyrics/{song name}?x_api_key=your_password_here
#### (also implemented password security)
